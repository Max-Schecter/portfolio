                    <li>I used Siemens NX for modeling and Blender to visualize the final designs.</li>
                    <li>The headlight and tail light cover is going to be manufactured using acrylic vaccum forming.</li>
                    <li>The housings are going to be 3d printed to due the bespoke nature of the proejct.</li>

                    <li>After careful consideration, we decided to scrap the tail light bar, instead opting for the two side light elements and a purelty strucutral member running accross the lenght of the vehilce.</li>
